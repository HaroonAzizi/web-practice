# 6th semester; JavaScript, PHP, Laravel, Bootstrap, Tailwind notes:

_2 - jan - 2025_

JavaScript and PHP are scripting languages.

2 types of scripting languages:

- Server Side: stored and executed on server. Used to provide user interaction.
- Client Side: executed on client computers. Browsers support the use of these types of scripts. These could be embedded in HTML docs.

##### History of Javascript:

Created byu Brendan Eich in 1995 in the span of 10 days. It was first called Mocha, later they called it LiveScript but for trademark reasons they finally renamed it to its current name 'javascript'.

##### Javascript:

Javascript is an object oriented language and is light weighted and interpreted language. To define a variable you can use `var`, `const` or `let` keywords.
To use js inside html you need to use the `<script>` `</script>` tags. To write something in HTML you need to use `document.write()`.
Variables assigned using `const` cannot be replaced later in code.

##### Array:

3 ways to construct an array in js:

- By array literal: `var arr = [val, val2, val23]`
- By creating instance of array directly (using the `new` keyword): `var emp = new Array()`
- By using an array constructor (using the `new` keyword): `var emp = new Array("haroon", "azizi")`

**? js local vs. global variables?**
**? for/in vs. for/of**
